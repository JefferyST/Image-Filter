# Image-Filter

## BilateralFilter
1.The algorithm is optimized by using lookup table.

## GaussianBlurFilter
1.The algorithm is optimized by using discrete convolution.

## RecursiveGaussianFilter
1.The algorithm is modified from the [blog](https://blog.csdn.net/webzhuce/article/details/100640543).
